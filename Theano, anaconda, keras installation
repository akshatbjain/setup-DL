    bash Anaconda2-4.1.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
    
- update conda and install theano

    conda update conda
    conda install theano
  
- Install keras

    conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/KEHANG keras
  
- Update
 
    pip install --upgrade --no-deps theano
    
- script to check
write gpu_check.py

run python gpu_check.py
  
  if it shows using cpu, then do the following
  
  create theanorc
  cd
